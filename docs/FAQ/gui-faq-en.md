Zonemaster
----------

<a name="q1"></a>
#### 1. What is Zonemaster?
Zonemaster is a program designed to help people check, measure and
hopefully also understand how the DNS (Domain Name System) works.

It consists of four components:

  1. Engine - a test framework that supports all functionality to perform DNS tests.
  2. CLI - a command-line interface to the Engine.
  3. Backend - a server that allows you to run Zonemaster tests and save results using
     a JSON-RPC API and a database.
  4. GUI - a web interface to the Backend.

When a domain (such as 'zonemaster.net') is submitted to Zonemaster (CLI or
GUI) it will investigate the domainâ€™s general health with a series of tests.
The different sanity checks and corresponding tests conducted by Zonemaster can be
found in the [Test Requirements] document.

<a name="q2"></a>
#### 2. Who is behind Zonemaster?
Zonemaster is a joint project between [AFNIC] (registry operator of '.fr' TLD and several other
TLDs, e.g. '.re', '.pm', '.tf', '.wf', '.yt' and '.paris') and the [Swedish Internet Foundation]
(registry operator of '.se' and '.nu' TLDs).

<a name="q3"></a>
#### 3. How can Zonemaster help me?
The Zonemaster tool is oriented towards two user categories:

  - Users who are knowledgable about the DNS protocol.
  - Users who just want to know whether the domain(s) they own or use
    have any issues or not.

Users of the second category should contact their DNS operator
in case they get results other than color-coded "green" for any
test of their domain name(s).

<a name="q4"></a>
#### 4. Zonemaster returns "Error" or "Warning" for my domain. What does it mean?
It depends on which test failed for your domain. Each test are accompanied with messages
describing the issues found.
You can also get further insight about each test from the [Implemented Test Cases] document.

<a name="q5"></a>
#### 5. How can Zonemaster distinguish between what is right and wrong?
There is not a definitive judgement of the health of a domain that can be bestowed by anyone.
The people behind Zonemaster do not claim that the tool is correct in every aspect.
Sometimes opinions differ.
We are doing our very best to create a default policy for errors found within this project,
with information primarly based on industry standards such as [RFCs].

Hopefully you will find in our tool a good compromise between what is an actual,
potentially dangerous *error* and what could be merely perceived as a *notice* or *warning*.
You can find more information on our vision of severity level in the [Severity Level Definitions] document.
However, note that one advantage of the tool is that it is always possible for one to add a policy file 
better suited to one's needs and ask the tool to use that policy file when running tests.
Such configuration is accessible through the "Options" button.

Finally, as with all things as evolving as the DNS, what is a *notice* today could be an *error* tomorrow.
If you think we have made a mistake in our judgement please do not hesitate to send us
an email at [zonemaster-users@lists.iis.se] (moderated mailing list) with a link to your test
result and an explanation as to why you think it shows something that you consider incorrect.

#### 6. Does Zonemaster support IPv6?
Yes. By default Zonemaster will query name servers both over IPv4 and IPv6, unless explicitly
configured otherwise.
Such configuration is accessible through the "Options" button.

<a name="q7"></a>
#### 7. Does Zonemaster support DNSSEC?
Yes. If DNSSEC is available for a domain that is tested by Zonemaster, it will be
checked automatically.
Note that you can also explicitly provide Delegation Signers (DS) records using the
"Options" button.

<a name="q8"></a>
#### 8. What makes Zonemaster differ from other DNS zone validating software?
Firstly, Zonemaster saves all history from earlier tests based on the tested
domain, which means you can go back to a test you did some time ago and compare it
to the test you ran just a moment ago.

Secondly, all tests that Zonemaster runs are defined in Test Case specifications that
can be found in the [Test Requirements] document.

Thirdly, Zonemaster can be used to test undelegated domains. Find more about undelegated
domains in [Question 12].

Lastly, this open source version of Zonemaster was built using modular code
which basically means that you can integrate parts of it in your own systems, if you wish.
For example, it is quite rare that you would want a complete program just to check for
redelegations.

<a name="q9"></a>
#### 9. Zonemaster and privacy
Since Zonemaster is open to everyone it is possible for anyone to check your
domain and its tests history.
However there is no way to tell who has run a specific test since nothing is
logged except the start time of the test.

<a name="q10"></a>
#### 10. How come my domain cannot be tested?
If we disregard the situation where a domain does not exist, such as when a
non-existing domain is input to Zonemaster, there are 2 other possibilities:
  - To protect the Engine from repetitive inputs, being the same IP
    checking the same domain several times, there is a delay of 5 minutes between
    subsequently identical tests.
    This means that you can only test the same domain once every 5 minutes,
    and if you try and test it again during that time the last results
    will be displayed instead.
  - Because Zonemaster was made to check domains, or DNS zones (e.g. 'zonemaster.net'), and
    not hostnames in a domain (e.g. 'www.zonemaster.net'), Zonemaster will
    report a failure if you try to test a hostname instead of a domain matching a
    DNS zone.

<a name="q11"></a>
#### 11. What kind of queries does Zonemaster generate?
Zonemaster send multiple DNS queries to the name servers hosting the domain tested and
also to the name servers hosting the parent zone of the domain tested.

For the time being, the GUI interface of Zonemaster does not show any queries sent.
Only the CLI interface can. If you want to see such queries, you will have to locally install
a minimally working Zonemaster instance with both the Engine and CLI components.
Queries sent can be shown using the 'DEBUG' level option.
Fair warning, the output from the CLI can be quite heavy.

<a name="q12"></a>
#### 12. What is an undelegated domain test?
An undelegated domain test is a test performed on a domain that may, or may not,
be fully published in the DNS.
This can be quite useful if one is going to move one's domain from one registrar to another,
e.g., move zone 'example.com' from the name server 'ns.example.com' to the name server 'ns.example.org'.
In this scenario one could perform an undelegated domain test providing the zone ('example.com')
and the name server you are moving to ('ns.example.org') *before* you move your domain.
When the results of the test are color-coded "green" one can be fairly certain that the
domain's new location is working well.
However there might still be other problems in the zone data itself that this test is unaware of.

#### 13. How can I test a "reverse" zone with Zonemaster?
To check a reverse zone with Zonemaster, one first needs to know what the
reverse zone is. If you want to check the reverse zone, you have to enter
it in the format that it has in the DNS, e.g.:

  - 3.2.1.in-addr.arpa
  - 6.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa
