      <p i18n>
        Give your domain name a complete checkup! Zonemaster helps you assess how your domain 
        name is doing. Besides, you can also get a better understanding of how the DNS 
        (Domain Name System) works. When a domain name is sent to Zonemaster for testing, 
        the program investigates the state of the domain name (sometimes called 'zone') 
        from top to bottom of the DNS tree. Specifically, this is usually done by 
        examining DNS data from the root ('.') to the TLD (Top-Level Domain; e.g., '.net') 
        for that domain name, and then finally through the DNS servers that contain authoritative 
        information about the specified domain name (e.g., 'zonemaster.net'). 
        Zonemaster performs many tests, such as checking DNSSEC signatures, or that different 
        hosts can be accessed and that IP addresses are valid. This is all to make sure that 
        your domain name runs as smoothly as possible.

      <h4 i18n>About the DNS</h4>
      <p i18n>
        Most people who use the Internet have never reflected on what actually happens 
        when one types an address in their web browser and then clicks the 'Enter' button. 
        In short, the DNS (Domain Name System) is a database that associates domain names 
        to IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, the same way a phone book associates names 
        to phone numbers. An IP address is a unique series of numbers that identifies every 
        computer that is connected to the Internet. It is similar to the way every telephone 
        has its own number in the telephone network. Such long series of numbers work fine 
        for computers, but for people it is way more difficult to memorize. Thus, the DNS has 
        been developed as an extra layer to map between names that we can remember better and 
        IP addresses used by computers whenever we want to reach a specific website or use 
        other services on the Internet (e.g., mail).
